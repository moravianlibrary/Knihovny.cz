;
; Available modules recommended for use in the side area:
;
; CatalogResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display catalog search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).  This is designed for use with non-catalog modules.
; DPLATerms:[collapsed]
;       Display results from the DPLA catalog. Provide a boolean to have the sidebar
;       collapsed or open on page load.
; EDSResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display EDS search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).
; EDSResultsDeferred:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Same as EDSResults, but loaded via AJAX.
; EuropeanaResults:[url]:[requestParam]:[limit]:[unwanted data providers]
;       Display search results from Europeana.eu API.
;       Parameters (all are optional):
;         [url] = base search URL, default api.europeana.eu/api/v2/opensearch.rss
;         [requestParam] = parameter name for passing lookup value in url, default is
;             "searchTerms"
;         [limit] = the number of result items to display (defaults to 5)
;         [unwanted data providers] = comma separated list of dataproviders to ignore
;             results from; useful for excluding your own results that are also in
;             Europeana.
;       An API key must be set in config.ini (see europeanaAPI setting in [Content]
;       section).
; EuropeanaResultsDeferred:[url]:[requestParam]:[limit]:[unwanted data providers]
;       See EuropeanaResults, but this version uses AJAX for asynchronous loading.
; ExpandFacets:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Display facets listed in the specified section of the specified ini file;
;       if [ini name] is left out, it defaults to "facets."  Rather than using
;       facets to limit the existing search, this module uses them to start a new
;       search showing all records matching the selected facet value.
; FacetCloud:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Same functionality as ExpandFacets, but with a more compact interface to
;       allow the display of more values.
; OpenLibrarySubjects:[GET parameter]:[limit]:[date filter]:[Subject types]
;       Display full-text, public scans from the Open Library (OL) Subjects API.
;       [GET parameter] (default = "lookfor"), [limit] (default = 5),
;       [date filter] The name of a date filter (from facet settings) to apply to
;           searches.  Defaults to "publishDate" if blank; set to "false" to disable.
;       [Subject types] (default = "topic") comma-separated list of subject types to
;           test. Open Library distinguishes between the following subject types:
;           topic,place,person,time
;       Note: an API call will be made for each type until valid data is returned
;           which will slow down the loading of the main VuFind result set,
;           see OpenLibrarySubjectsDeferred
; OpenLibrarySubjectsDeferred:[GET parameter]:[limit]:[date filter]:[Subject types]
;       The same as OpenLibrarySubjects but uses AJAX to make the API calls after the
;           main result set has loaded
; SideFacets:[regular facet section]:[checkbox facet section]:[ini name]
;       Display the specified facets, where [ini name] is the name of an ini file
;       in your config directory (defaults to "facets" if not supplied),
;       [regular facet section] is the name of a section of the ini file containing
;       standard facet settings (defaults to "Results" if not specified),
;       and [checkbox facet section] is the name of a section of the ini file
;       containing checkbox facet settings (leave blank for no checkbox facets).
;       Checkbox facets are normally in filter => label format; prefix the section
;       name with ~ to reverse this and use label => filter format (useful if your
;       filters contain values that are illegal in configuration keys -- e.g. []).
; SummonDatabases:[GET parameter]
;       Display Summon-generated database recommendations matching the terms found
;       in the specified GET parameter.  NOTE: If you are using this module with a
;       Summon search, the [GET parameter] setting will be ignored and the actual
;       current Summon search will be used instead.  The parameter only needs to be
;       specified when combining this module with a non-Summon-based search module.
; SummonResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display Summon search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).
; WebResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display website search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).  This requires the website Solr core to be active.
;
; Available modules recommended for use in the top area:
;
; AuthorFacets
;       Display author names based on the search term.
; AuthorInfo:[use_viaf]
;       Load author information from external providers based on the current search
;       and the "authors" setting in the [Content] section of config.ini.
;       The [use_viaf] setting may be set to true to use the VIAF web service in
;       combination with your Solr authority index to pick more appropriate authors;
;       this defaults to false if unset.  If you do not have local authority records
;       to draw on, the OCLC FAST data works well with the [use_viaf] option; see:
;       https://vufind.org/wiki/indexing:open_data_sources#oclc_fast
; AuthorityRecommend:[field1]:[query1]:[field2]:[query2]:...:[field-n]:[query-n]
;       Displays see and see also results to user based on search of Authority Index.
;       Any number of filter queries may be specified as parameters to limit which
;       set of authority records is used for recommendations; for example:
;           AuthorityRecommend:record_type:Heading* OR Topical*:source:FAST
;       limits record_type to strings starting with "Heading" or "Topical" and
;       limits source to FAST. A special field name of "__resultlimit__" may be
;       used to suppress authority results when the result set contains more items
;       than the number specified as the corresponding value (e.g. if you configure
;       AuthorityRecommend:__resultlimit__:50 then authority recommendations will
;       only display on result screens displaying fewer than 50 hits; by default,
;       recommendations will always display). A special field name of "__mode__"
;       may be used to control what type of suggestions are presented (default is
;       both seealso and usefor results, but you can turn on just one of these
;       options if desired; for example "__mode__:seealso" would only show "see
;       also" results from records whose main headings match the current search
;       terms while "__mode__:usefor" would show only main headings from records
;       whose "use for" headings match the current search. You can use "__mode__:*"
;       to turn on all options (but this is default behavior if no __mode__ is
;       set). Filtering is optional. A special field name of "__header__" may be
;       used to customize the header text above the results (default = "See also").
; Channels
;       Display a link to the Channeled Browse functionality leading to channels of
;       records related to the current search.
; MapSelection
;       Enable geographic searching capability by activating this module.
;       Records must be indexed using the geographic search and display fields.
;       See the marc_local.properties file for more information on indexing.
;       See the [MapSelection] section of the geofeatures.ini file for more information.
; PubDateVisAjax:[zooming]:[facet field 1]:[facet field 2]:...:[facet field n]
;       Display a visualization of publication dates for each of the specified facet
;       fields.  This is designed for a field containing four-digit years.  Zooming
;       is set to either true or false and controls whether or not selecting part of
;       the graph zooms in to greater detail.
; TopFacets:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Display facets listed in the specified section of the specified ini file;
;       if [ini name] is left out, it defaults to "facets."
; WorldCatIdentities
;       Use the WorldCat Identities API to find names and related subjects based
;       on the current search.
;
; Available modules recommended for use in the "no results" area:
;
; AlphaBrowseLink:index
;       Use the query to generate a link to the specified alphabrowse index
; DOI:[prefix]
;       Detect DOIs in the user search query. If a DOI makes up part of the search,
;       display a link to resolve it. If it makes up the entire query, redirect to
;       the resolver automatically. [prefix] is the URL of the resolver to which
;       the DOI itself will be appended.
; ExternalSearch:[link label]:[url template]
;       Display a link to an external search system. The contents of the <a> tag
;       will be [link label] (which will be run through the translator -- use a
;       translation string if you need to display a string containing a colon).
;       The href will be [url template] with %%lookfor%% replaced with the current
;       search's lookfor parameter. If you omit the %%lookfor%% placeholder, the
;       search terms will simply be appended to the end of the URL template.
; Libraryh3lp:[type]:[id]:[skin]
;       Display a chat box for the Libraryh3lp service. [type] indicates the type
;       of chat being used (either "queue" or "user"). [id] is the name of the
;       queue or user. [skin] is optional and specifies a skin number to use.
; RecommendLinks:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Display a list of recommended links, taken from [ini section] in
;       [ini name], where the section is a mapping of label => URL. [ini name]
;       defaults to searches.ini, and [ini section] defaults to RecommendLinks.
; RemoveFilters
;       Suggests removing facet filters to retrieve more results.
; SwitchQuery:[backend]:[opt-out checks to skip]:[opt-in checks to add]
;       This module analyzes the user's query and offers suggestions for ways to
;       improve it. [backend] is the name of the search backend currently in use,
;       which will help with accurate analysis (default = Solr). [opt-out checks
;       to skip] is a comma-separated list of checks which are on by default but
;       which you wish to disable. [opt-in checks to add] is a comma-separated
;       list of transforms that are off by default but which you wish to enable.
;       See the check*() methods in the module's code for a complete list of
;       available checks. The $optInMethods property specifies which checks are
;       turned off by default.
; SwitchTab
;       If multiple tabs are active, suggest that the user try searching in a
;       different one.
; SwitchType:[field]:[field description]
;       If the current search type is not the same as [field], display a link
;       suggesting that the user try switching to [field].  [field description]
;       is the human-readable description of [field].  Default values are
;       'AllFields' and 'All Fields' respectively.

;Library of Congress Online Catalog = http://catalog.loc.gov/

; This section controls the "New Items" search.
[NewItem]
; New item information can be retrieved from Solr or from the ILS; this setting
; controls which mechanism is used. If using Solr, change tracking must be enabled
; (see https://vufind.org/wiki/indexing:tracking_record_changes). If using the ILS,
; your driver must support the getNewItems() method.
; Valid options: ils, solr; default: ils
method = solr
; Comma-separated list of date ranges to offer to the user (i.e. 1,5,30 = one day
; old, or five days old, or thirty days old).  Be careful about raising the maximum
; age too high -- searching very long date ranges may put a load on your ILS.
ranges = 1,5,30
; This setting only applies when using the "ils" method. It controls the maximum
; number of pages of results that will show up when doing a new item search.
; It is necessary to limit the number of results to avoid getting a "too many boolean
; clauses" error from the Solr index (see notes at
; https://vufind.org/jira/browse/VUFIND-128 for more details).  However, if you
; set the value too low, you may get the same results no matter which range setting
; is selected!
result_pages = 20
; This setting can be used to automatically apply filter queries to the New Item
; results.  For example, you might want to filter out certain content types.  You
; can add multiple filters by repeating the "filter[] =" line, or you can skip
; filtering entirely by leaving the line commented out.
; filter[] = "format:Book"

; This section controls RSS feed behavior
[RSS]
; If set, this setting will override sort settings associated with RSS feeds.  This
; allows you to ensure that newly added or changed items in your index appear at
; the top of the feed.  Use "first_indexed desc" if you only want newly-added items
; to be listed first.  Use "last_indexed desc" if you want newly-added-or-changed
; items.  Comment out the whole setting if you do not want custom RSS sorting.
; IMPORTANT: In order for first_indexed and last_indexed sorting to work properly,
;            you need to index record change dates; see the Wiki page at
;            https://vufind.org/wiki/indexing:tracking_record_changes
sort = "last_indexed desc"

; The following two sections control the behavior of the autocomplete drop-downs
; associated with search boxes.  The [Autocomplete] section contains global default
; settings, while the [Autocomplete_Types] section allows you to associate different
; autocomplete handlers with different search handlers.
;
; The available autocomplete handlers are:
;
; Eds:[Mode]
;       Use the EBSCO Discovery Service autocomplete handler (only intended to be
;       used in the context of the EDS backend). [Mode] can be either "holdings" for
;       title completion in PubFinder or "rawqueries" for completion of basic textual
;       queries.
; None
;       Do not provide any suggestions.  You should use this handler if you want to
;       disable suggestions for one search type while still providing suggestions
;       for other search types.  To disable suggestions completely, it is better to
;       use the "enabled" setting in the [Autocomplete] section.
; SolrAuth:[Search Handler]:[Display Field]:[Sort Field]:[Filters]
;       See Solr below -- this handler behaves exactly the same, except
;       it uses the Solr authority data index rather than the bibliographic index,
;       and its default [Display Field] value is "heading".
; Solr:[Search Handler]:[Display Field]:[Sort Field]:[Filters]
;       Perform a wildcarded search against [Search Handler], using the contents of
;       [Display Field] (a comma-separated, priority-ordered field list) as
;       suggestions and sorting by [Sort Field].  Any additional parameters at the
;       end of the string are treated as an alternating sequence of field names and
;       values for use as filters against the suggestion list.  All parameters are
;       optional.  If omitted, [Search Handler] will use the default Solr field,
;       [Display Field] will use "title", [Sort Field] will use relevance and no
;       filters will be applied.
; SolrCN
;       A customized version of Solr designed for smart handling of
;       call numbers using the custom CallNumber search handler.
; Tag
;       Provide suggestions from the local database of tags.
;
; You can build your own autocomplete modules if you wish.  See the developer's
; guide here:
;
;       https://vufind.org/wiki/development:plugins:autosuggesters
[Autocomplete]
; Set this to false to disable all autocomplete behavior
enabled = true
; This handler will be used for all search types not covered by [Autocomplete_Types]

; Auto-submit autocomplete on click or enter
auto_submit = true

; In this section, set the key equal to a search handler from searchspecs.yaml and
; the value equal to an autocomplete handler in order to customize autocompletion
; behavior when that search type is selected.

; When snippets are enabled, this section can be used to display captions based on
; the Solr fields from which the snippets were obtained.  Keys are the names of Solr
; fields and values are strings to display to the user.  Note that all displayed
; strings are subject to translation and should be accounted for in the language
; files found in web/lang if you are in a multilingual environment.  Fields that are
; not listed in this section will be displayed without captions, so you can comment
; out the whole section to disable captions.

; This section allows sharding to be used to pull in content from additional Solr
; servers.  All servers used in sharding must contain the same index fields needed
; to satisfy queries sent to them AND they must all include different ID numbers!
; Leave this commented out to disable sharding.
; To use sharding, simply fill in lines using the format:
; [display name of shard] = [URL of shard (without http://)]
;[IndexShards]
;Library Catalog = localhost:8983/solr/biblio
;Website = localhost:8983/solr/website

; This section allows you to set preferences for shards display.  You only need to
; set these if you want to use shards.  See also the [StripFields] section below
; if your shards have non-identical schemas.
;[ShardPreferences]
; This setting controls whether or not to display checkboxes to allow the user to
; select which shard(s) to search (default if commented out = false)
;showCheckboxes = true
; These lines determine which shards are searched by default if the user hasn't
; specified preferences using checkboxes (default if commented out = all shards):
;defaultChecked[] = "Library Catalog"
;defaultChecked[] = "Website"

; Fields must be stripped if you have a field in your main index which is missing
; from any index includable by shards.  This section can be ignored if you are
; not using sharding or if all of your shards have identical schemas.
;
; Put in the fields to strip here in the following format:
; shard name = fieldname,another fieldname,...
[StripFields]

; This section defines the view options available on standard search results.
; If only one view is required, set default_view under [General] above, and
; leave this section commented out.
[Views]
list = List
;table = Table
;grid = Grid

; This section controls what happens when a record title in a search result list
; is clicked. VuFind can either embed the full result directly in the list using
; AJAX or can display it at its own separate URL as a full HTML page.
; full - separate page (default)
; tabs - embedded using tabs (see record/ajaxview-tabs.phtml)
; accordion - embedded using an accordion (see record/ajaxview-accordion.phtml)
; NOTE: This feature is incompatible with SyndeticsPlus content; please use
;       regular Syndetics if necessary.
[List]

; This section allows for adding hidden filters. Each filter will be translated
; to format 'key:"value"' and added by Solr.php as a hidden filter (a facet that
; is always applied but is not seen by the user).  This is useful if you use a
; shared Solr index and need to display different subsets in different contexts
; (for example, a union catalog with separate VuFind instances each member).
[HiddenFilters]
;merged_child_boolean = true
;institution = "MyInstitution"

; This section is an alternative to [HiddenFilters] when you need to create more
; advanced types of filters -- i.e. complex boolean queries.  Keys are ignored,
; but increasing numeric values (1, 2, 3...) are recommended.  Values are fully-
; formed filter queries.
[RawHiddenFilters]
;0 = "NOT merged_child_boolean:true"
;0 = "format:\"Book\" OR format:\"Journal\""
;1 = "language:\"English\" OR language:\"French\""
0 = "NOT recordtype:\"library\""

; This section can get used to define conditional filters, i.e. filters
; that are applied under certain conditions.
; You can use a permission set as condition, which has to be defined in
; permissions.ini.
; Keys are ignored, but increasing numeric values (1, 2, 3...) are recommended.
; Values need to be formatted using this schema:
; [-]permission|filter-query
; Prefixing the condition with a minus (-) means that the filter is applied
; when the condition does not match (the permission is not granted).
; The filter may be any filter query valid for Solr.
; Examples:
; -conditionalFilter.MyUniversity|format:Book
; apply filter "format:Book" if permission conditionalFilter.MyUniversity
; (from permissions.ini) is not granted
; conditionalFilter.MyUniversity|format:Article
; apply filter "format:Article" if permission conditionalFilter.MyUniversity
; (from permissions.ini) is granted
[ConditionalHiddenFilters]
;0 = "-conditionalFilter.MyUniversity|format:Book"
;1 = "conditionalFilter.MyUniversity|format:Article"

; This section defines how records are handled when being fetched from Solr.
[Records]
; Boolean value indicating if deduplication is enabled. If true, deduplication is
; enabled. If false, dedup records are filtered out. If unspecified, deduplication
; support is completely disabled.
deduplication = true
; TODO: Do we need this parameter?
; Deduplication type - default / child (for portal views with filtered records)
;deduplication_type = default

institution_field = local_region_institution_facet_str_mv
; Priority order (descending) for record sources (record ID prefixes separated
; from the actual record by period, e.g. testsrc.12345)
;sources = alli,testsrc

; This section defines settings used to fetch similar records.
[MoreLikeThis]
; Boolean value indicating whether the newer MoreLikeThis query handler should be
; used instead of the traditional MoreLikeThis component (default). Only the
; MoreLikeThis query handler supports sharded indexes, but as of this writing, the
; traditional component offers more nuanced relevance ranking. Results from these
; methods may differ.
;useMoreLikeThisHandler = true
; If the MoreLikeThis handler is used, this setting can be used to adjust its
; behavior. See https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Other+Parsers#OtherParsers-MoreLikeThisQueryParser
; for more information regarding the possible parameters.
;params = "qf=title,title_short,callnumber-label,topic,language,author,publishDate mintf=1 mindf=1";
; This setting can be used to limit the maximum number of suggestions. Default is 5.
;count = 5

; This section controls the behavior of the Search/Home screen.
[HomePage]
; Content blocks can be selected from the list below:
;
; Channels:[source] - Display the homepage channels for the specified [source].
; [source] defaults to Solr.
;
; FacetList:[source]:[column size] - Display a list of facet values
; drawn from the [source] backend, with a maximum of [column size] values per
; column. [source] defaults to Solr and [column size] defaults to 10.
;
; IlsStatusMonitor:[target] - Performs an AJAX health check of the ILS and
; prepends a warning message to the HTML element identified by the jQuery selector
; provided in [target] (which defaults to .searchHomeContent.
;
; TemplateBased:[template] - Display the content of template defined after colon.
; The template could be in phtml or md (markdown) format and has to be saved in
; ContentBlock/TemplateBased/ directory of your theme. You can use language code
; filename suffixes to present the content in different languages. For example,
; you could add "content[] = TemplateBased:foo" to the settings below, then create
; a ContentBlock/TemplateBased/foo.phtml (or foo.md) file in your theme's templates
; directory to provide default content. If you wanted a different version of the
; page for the German language, you could create a foo_de.phtml or foo_de.md file,
; and that version would be loaded when the user's language was set to German.
;content[] = IlsStatusMonitor
;content[] = FacetList
