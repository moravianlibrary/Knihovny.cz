Footer text = Benefit from the convenience and simplicity of searching dozens of Czech libraries' catalogs at once. Use library services, order, download - anytime and anywhere.
; old Footer text = The portal Knihovny.cz is the result of several years of development targeted at creating a central point where you can simultaneously search the catalogues of libraries across the Czech Republic and find information about their resources, services and events. The objective was to find a solution, thanks to which you can easily get a book or information, without having to physically visit the given library or search the databases of the individual libraries in a complicated way.
